added quadrupole for tune modulation. 

#new format for TM_QUAD entries in the collimator database

1: STRING					NAME UPPERCASE 
2: STRING					name (lowercase)
3: DOUBLE					lenght [m]
4: DOUBLE					(quadrupole) angle of the focusing  plane [rad] 0=HOR
						(dipole) angle of the active plane [rad] 0=HOR
5: DOUBLE DOUBLE				center_x[m] center_y[m]
6: DOUBLE					(quadrupole) gradient kick per length unit (rad/m^2) 
						(dipole) kick per length unit (rad/m^2) 
7: DOUBLE DOUBLE    DOUBLE	DOUBLE 	INT 	operation tune, multiplication factor 
						Delta tune, tune increment per step
8: LOGIC				 	if true, the quad polarity can be inverted
8: DOUBLE					database beta x

funny results for 0 elens Voltage!
fixed by imposing a check on elens current & voltage before calling the elens routine

        driftsx   driftsy  cut_input systilt_antisymm  physical   diffusive

the new parameters are:
physical:    if true, the values of driftsx and driftsy are amplitude increase per turn in m
diffusive:   if true, the amplitude change per turn is ran[-1:1]*driftsx  and ran[-1:1]*driftsy

#change in the code:
#random mode for elens in changed - not ON-OFF, but random noise between 0 and 1. Still to be proved to be more/less effective
#thank the ON-OFF mode. In case, remove the logical "switch"  variable.

#I have verified that the number of particles which are still running + the number of particles in the FLUKA_impacts is **NOT***
#the initial number of particles. I thought it was an error introduced by elens but then I verified it happen with the 
#previous database Sixtrack version. I supsect it comes from the eleminitation of the particles at high amplitude nut not absorbed. 
#It is clear when I run the code with only one collimator in.


#included triangular distribution between 2 extremes - meaning triangular in the amplitude space. 
#associated to distribution n. 5. 
#on momentum particles.
